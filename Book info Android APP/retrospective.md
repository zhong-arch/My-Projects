# Retrospective

## What went well
After iteration 1 and 2, we noticed that android development is not as hard as we thought at the beginning of iteration 1. Due to the COVID-19, we can't meet face to face regularly. However, we did more talks by Messenger, which really helps us to distribute tasks and solve developing problems.
We also have better implementation of git than before so that most time the group members are able to use the sample version for adding new functions to the project, and using git helps us to control and merge different branches.

## What need imporvement:

We meet some problems with database, because we don't know much how to use the HSQLDB during iteration 2, our goal is just let the database work. We don't consider too much about how we should set up the relation of each table, and how to make query more faster. As a result, in iteration 3, when we need to add more features into the app, the interaction between database layer and bussiness logic layer brought us some hardness.

## How to improve:

We could improve database performance by discuss the relationship between all the table at begining of building database, some of our group members takes database course and as a group, we could draw the relation model before coding.
