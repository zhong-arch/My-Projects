<p>
Awemany Books is a convenient way for everyone to browse and contrast books right from their android device. The app will be a personalized database of books that allows a user to find a book they are looking for conveniently and quickly. Also, users will be able to create and personalize their accounts. An ability to save their information via account would help to provide a pleasant experience with the system.
</p><p>
The app will allow users to search through the database as well as look through several categories such as top-rated books or personalized recommendations. Once a user finds a book they are interested in they will be able to open the book's page that includes information about it like the name of the author, pictures, and costs at different bookstores. Every book will also have a review section that will contain an average rating and comments from users who purchased and used this book before.
</p><p>
To enrich a user's experience, every user will be allowed to create collections and to add books there. That will help them to track which books they need or want to read in the future. Users will also have a user history, which will keep information about their recent activities such as comments, ratings, and viewed books.
</p><p>
The app will be open to the public and will be used by anyone who has an android device and is interested in discovering new books. Due to the wide range of customers, the main focus of the system will be addressed to the facilitation of the user's experience. The app is encouraging a user to go out and read a book rather than trying to sell it as a product, which allows the application to be proud of its impartiality in the provided information.
</p><p>
In the pre-release of the app, the number of books will be limited to a small selection chosen by the development team. After the release, the content library is expected to grow exponentially, and the content will be updated regularly. Further, beta testers will add some comments and reviews with varying degrees of real-world accuracy for the pre-release. Once the release occurs, all the comments and reviews from the pre-release will be removed, so in the future, the data gained is accurate and reflects the general public.
</p><p>
The main goal of the program is to encourage reading in individuals by providing them with a convenient way to find reading material. Nowadays, reading becomes a less and less common way of obtaining information since people look to more entertainment ways like watching videos. Awemany Books looks to bring back the enjoyment of reading by providing users with a convenient and effortless way to find the next great read.
</p><p>
Additionally, this application can be used as a forum by those who love to read and want to share their experiences and passion with others.
</p><p>
The application's success will be judged based on two criteria. The first one is the user's feedback, which will be measured through a survey given to several beta testers. These testers will be asked to record their time spent reading for two weeks before their first time using the app and then for two weeks while using the app. These results will be recorded and the change in time will be calculated. If the number of reading hours increases, the app will be considered successful in encouraging increased reading. The second measure of the applications success is the amount of downloads the app has received and the growth rate of downloads. The goal of the application is to provide readers a convenient way to find books, so the more users the app has, the greater itâ€™s success. An exponential growth is also expected as initial users will hopefully recommend the app to others causing a rapid growth in the number of users. This type of growth would only be expected if users are enjoying the app and finding it useful in their reading pursuits.

		Learn from project: We learned that the project is actually easier than you might think if you started to do it. During the development, problem always shows up but project is a processing of solving problems. Communication is also important to group project, with frequent communication, the project velocity increased and the project got easier.
</p><p>
	Conclusion of our project: We have done almost all the features for iteration0, and based on our feedback of iteraton1 and iteration2, our group make a great progress. Our group's development skill imporved a lot through this project and we have deeper understanding of managing software project.
