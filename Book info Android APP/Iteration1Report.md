# Notes On Iteration 1
* Most of the functionality desired was implemented in iteration 1
* Due to time constraints, some techincal debt was added in the view model layer as well as the android interaction layers
   * This will be addresed in iteration 2 and will have a likely refactor 
* Testing was minimal due to little logic required for this iteration, mocking will be used more in iteration 2 and some test may be refactored
* Optimized for Google Nexus 7 Tablet
* Overall the team is happy with the release!
