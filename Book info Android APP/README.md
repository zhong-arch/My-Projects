Awemany Books is a convenient way for everyone to browse and contrast books right from their android device. The app will be a personalized database of books that allows a user to find a book they are looking for conveniently and quickly. Also, users will be able to create and personalize their accounts. An ability to save their information via account would help to provide a pleasant experience with the system. 

### Users
Our Users are anyone who likes to read books or is trying to get into reading but doesnt know which books to read. No matter if you are a beginner reader or have been reading for years Awemany Books aims to find a book for you!

### Functionality
The purpose of the project was to create an application that allows a user to find books to read. The application does this by providing a database full of books and information about these books that help users find books that interest them.

Feature 1: Viewing all books in the app
Description: The user should be able to view a list of all books in the application.

Feature 2: Search for a book through this app
Description: The ability to search through the library of books hosted on the app. Search results should accurately represent the criteria searched for.

Feature 3: Detailed book Information
Description: Each book should have its own page when clicked on. This page will have all of the information about the book including price, title, description of the book, author and publishing info. Pictures of the book should also be available on this page.

Feature 4: Creating and using user accounts
Description: Users should have accounts that track a variety of information to aid user experience. These accounts will help tailor the app experience to each particular user.

Feature 5: Viewing previous activities (a.k.a. History)
Description: Users should be able to view the recent history of the books that they have viewed.

Feature 6: Create User Book Lists
Description: Users should be able to generate a list of books which they would like to access in the future. This list should be linked to there account so that it is accessible whenever they are on the app and logged in to their account.

Feature 7: New Books Finder
Description: There will be a randomized list of 3 books from that database, that the user can shuffle to find random books in the database.

Feature 8: Comments and Ratings
Description: Each book will have a comment and ratings section. The comments section will allow users to leave comments on books in which they can share their thoughts about the book. The review section will let users give the books a rating on a scale from 1-3.

Featrue 9: Top clicked books
Description: There will be a section in the app that contains the top viewed books. This collection will contain a certain number of books that will vary based on the books that are viewed the most by users in the app.

### Features
The app will allow users to search through the database as well as look through several categories such as top-rated books or personalized recommendations. Once a user finds a book they are interested in they will be able to open the book's page that includes information about it like the name of the author, pictures, and costs at different bookstores. Every book will also have a review section that will contain an average rating and comments from users who purchased and used this book before. 

To enrich a user's experience, every user will be allowed to create collections and to add books there. That will help them to track which books they need or want to read in the future. Users will also have a user history, which will keep information about their recent activities such as comments, ratings, and viewed books. 

The app will be open to the public and will be used by anyone who has an android device and is interested in discovering new books. Due to the wide range of customers, the main focus of the system will be addressed to the facilitation of the user's experience. The app is encouraging a user to go out and read a book rather than trying to sell it as a product, which allows the application to be proud of its impartiality in the provided information. 

In the pre-release of the app, the number of books will be limited to a small selection chosen by the development team. After the release, the content library is expected to grow exponentially, and the content will be updated regularly. Further, beta testers will add some comments and reviews with varying degrees of real-world accuracy for the pre-release. Once the release occurs, all the comments and reviews from the pre-release will be removed, so in the future, the data gained is accurate and reflects the general public. 

The main goal of the program is to encourage reading in individuals by providing them with a convenient way to find reading material. Nowadays, reading becomes a less and less common way of obtaining information since people look to more entertainment ways like watching videos. Awemany Books looks to bring back the enjoyment of reading by providing users with a convenient and effortless way to find the next great read. Additionally, this application can be used as a forum by those who love to read and want to share their experiences and passion with others. 

The application's success will be judged based on two criteria. The first one is the user's feedback, which will be measured through a survey given to several beta testers. These testers will be asked to record their time spent reading for two weeks before their first time using the app and then for two weeks while using the app. These results will be recorded and the change in time will be calculated. If the number of reading hours increases, the app will be considered successful in encouraging increased reading. The second measure of the applications success is the amount of downloads the app has received and the growth rate of downloads. The goal of the application is to provide readers a convenient way to find books, so the more users the app has, the greater it’s success. An exponential growth is also expected as initial users will hopefully recommend the app to others causing a rapid growth in the number of users. This type of growth would only be expected if users are enjoying the app and finding it useful in their reading pursuits.
